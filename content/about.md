Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Yahia Djemmada, and I'm a lecturer at the National Higher School of Mathematics ([NHSM](http://nhsm.edu.dz/)) in Algiers, Algeria.

I've always been passionate about mathematics and computer sciences, and have pursued this interest through my education and career. I obtained my PhD degree in mathematics at University Of Science And Technology Houari Boumediene ([USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/)).

In addition to my work as a lecturer, I'm also an active researcher in the fields of **combinatorics** and **discrete mathematics**, and have published some [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3kStp0sAAAAJ&hl=en) on these topics.

On this website, you'll find the materials of my lectures, my publications,...; I hope you find it informative and helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me through my [contacts](./contact).

Thank you for your visit, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.

Best regards,
